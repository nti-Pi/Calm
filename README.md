# Calm
A little Python script I use to relax when panicking about how my code doesn't work.

## Instructions
* Ensure you have Python and pip installed. I tested it with Python 3.6.
* Navigate to the Calm directory and, while connected to the internet, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Calm's dependencies.
* Run `python Calm.py`shiauhsiuhiuh
