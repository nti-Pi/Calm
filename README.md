# Calm
A small Python script I wrote to help me relax.

## Instructions
* Ensure you have Python and pip installed. I tested and wrote Calm using Python 3.6.
* Navigate to the Calm directory and, while connected to the internet, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Calm's dependencies.
* Run `python Calm.py` to execute the script. Hit escape to quit.

## Additional Notes:
  * To run in windowed mode, use the `-w` or `--windowed` flag. For example, either of the following commands will work:
      * `python Calm.py --windowed`
      * `python Calm.py -w`

  * If you use a Linux-based system, you might need to replace `python` in the above command line instructions with `python3`, since the former invokes a Python 2 interpreter by default.
